DotNetTestNSpec is a NSpec runner for .NET Core command line interface and Visual Studio
IDE.

It runs NSpec tests in .NET Core projects targeting both .NET Core and .NET Framework,
both from console - taking advantage of *dotnet test* command line interface - as well as
from Visual Studio Test Explorer window.

For more info on NSpec testing framework, please see
[its project](https://github.com/nspec/NSpec) or [nspec.org](http://nspec.org/) website.

## Minimum requirements

It currently supports projects based on .NET Core Tools Preview 2, the ones with 
`project.json` and `.xproj` files, hence the only allowed Visual Studio IDE is 2015.

## Examples

See [NSpec](https://github.com/nspec/NSpec) project, at path
[examples/DotNetTestSample](https://github.com/nspec/NSpec/tree/master/examples/DotNetTestSample),
for a standalone solution with following features:

  * separate main and test project, 
  * import of NSpec and this runner as dependencies, 
  * allows running tests from *dotnet* command line interface and Visual Studio IDE.
